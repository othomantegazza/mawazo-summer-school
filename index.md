# Tools

## R and Rstudio

You can run within Visual Studio Code, in the docker container provided by the summer school organizers.

Otherwise, you can also:

- Install R from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/).
- Install the [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) interface. 


Remeber! R works with packages.

## Install a package

First install the package with `install.packages()` (you only have to do it once).


## Load a package

Then load it with `library()`, to make it's functions available. (you have to do it at the beginning of each of your scripts).



## Packages that we are going to use:

Please install this packages:

```r
install.packages(c('tidyverse', 'palmerpenguins', 'here', 'broom', 'janitor'))
```

and place this snippet of code in front of all your scripts.

```r
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(palmerpenguins)
library(broom)
library(janitor)
```
