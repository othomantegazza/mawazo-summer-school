# Quick history of R
 
## The R Project for Statistical Computing

[https://www.r-project.org/](https://www.r-project.org/)

- Started in 1991 by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of Auckland (NZ).
- Made **open source** in 1995.
- Official "peer reviewed" packages are hosted on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/).
- Has multiple "universes" of packages, including [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/) dedicated to bioinformatics, and the [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) for Data Science. 
- Great for analyzing data, for statistics, for research and for communicating data to others.


## A bit more on R

- We are going to use the **[Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/)**. But you might have to learn also a bit of the original idiom, now called **base R**, which sometimes helps if you have to programm your own functions.
- We are going to use R in [visual studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as you did for Python, but you might want to try out also [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), which is a great open source IDE dedicated to R.

# Resources

## As always, stackoverflow is your friend

If you need help, as always, Google and [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r?sort=MostVotes) are your friends.

. . .

But sometimes you need to learn on a support that is structured, nuanced and detailed... üìö


## A helpful and welcoming community üìö

One of the things that makes R great is its community of users and programmer.

It is **open source** and **open access** oriented and highly dedicated to lowering the barrier to learning R and data science, and make their tools available and usable to everyone.
