# Why Statistical Models

When you reach the limit of what graphical exploration and summary statistics can tell you, you can use statistical models to explore your data.

## Why?

When we look for **insights** in complex datasets, sometimes we want to know:

- Is there a **multivariate pattern** in the data? One that is evident only when we compare multiple variables at once.
- Are the patterns that we observe in data there **by chance**? Or are they **caused** by something.

## Which models?

### Supervised models

We will use **linear models** to see if we could **"predict"** the number of spikelets from the number primary branches. 

### Unsupervised models

We will use **clustering** and **Principal Component Analysis** to detect multivariate patterns in the data.
